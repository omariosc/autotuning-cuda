# Autotuning System - Issues and TODO List

**Original Author**: Ben Spencer  
**Status**: Legacy issues from Python 2 version  
**Python 3 Status**: Many issues resolved through modernization, others updated below

This document contains the original issues and TODO items identified by Ben Spencer during development of the Python 2.5+ version. Items marked with âœ… have been resolved in the Python 3 modernization, while others remain as enhancement opportunities.

## Error Checking

- **MORE ERROR CHECKING EVERYWHERE**

## Performance Issues

- **Why is the self-demonstration so slow?** This is since the move to Evaluators from evaluation functions. (see below)

## Code Cleanup and Refactoring

- Clean up implementation of `test_evaluations.py`. `generateEvalFunc()` should be incorporated into `FuncEvaluator` (which might be renamed).

## Visualization Improvements

- Make gnuplot output cleverer when choosing the positions of xtics. Currently they are placed every 5 tests, no matter how many there are.

## Configuration

- Check which settings in the conf file are affected by line breaks and in what way. Document or fix.

## Examples and Demonstrations

- Add compiler flag testing to the matrix multiply example. This would make it a better demonstration of the system.

## UI/Display Enhancements

- Allow the tree printer to use the proper box-drawing characters.
  - **UPDATE:** Added this as an option, but need to test if they can be displayed before it can be used. Currently the setting is hardcoded in `vartree.py`

## Code Architecture

- Be clear whether the list of vars comes from the VarTree or from possValues in various places. The VarTree is the definitive source.

## Testing Features

- Offer the option of running only a single test, to check that everything is working correctly.
  - **UPDATE:** We decided a better idea would be to simply quit (which is now more graceful) or only specify one possibility in the conf file, in which case the documentation should include this tip.

## Optimization Strategy

- Propose that 'optimal' can choose between 'min_time' and 'min_custom' or something similar (min_score, min_measurement, ...?). 'min' is the obvious choice at the moment, but doesn't do what you'll most likely want.

## System Behavior Issues

- The system seems to sometimes (not always) run some extra tests for the additional parameter importance information which are not needed. Seen when tuning the 'hello' example, which shouldn't require any extra tests, but sometimes seems to run some (tested on the laptop).

## Documentation Updates

- Update documentation to use the following method of running the tuner:

  ```bash
  ~/Autotuning/autotune
  ```

  **NOT:**
  
  ```bash
  ../../autotune
  ../../tuner/tune.py
  ```

- This should be the same for the utilities as well:
  
  ```bash
  ~/Autotuning/utilities/output_gnuplot.py
  ```

## Tutorial Ideas

- Nicer, more friendly stylesheet
- What is the "what you'll need" section typically called?
- Better implementation of the grey terminal listing boxes
- Include an example of using a custom FOM with the matrix multiply example
